sdev = stdev of X explained by each PC 
rotation = matrix whose columns contain PC loadings for each PC
center = pre-adjusted mean of each variable
scale = pre-adjusted stdev of each variable
x = matrix whose (i,j)th entry is the jth PC score of observation i. These are PC's. 
```{r}
#pr_output$rotation weird since no predictors; dealing with images
dim(pr_output$rotation)
hist(freight_red_only)
#so its 1280 rows, 1029 columns. 
#this is a histogram of the pixel intensities

#could also take an "average" of the pixel intensities here if we liked. Using red was an 
#arbitrary choice in the in-class example
```

Scree plots
```{r}
pr_variation <- pr_output$sdev^2 
pve <- pr_variation / sum(pr_variation) 
par(mfrow = c(1,2)) 
plot(pve, xlab = "Principal Component", ylab = "Proportion of Variance Explained")
plot(cumsum(pve), xlab = "Principal Component", ylab = "Cumulative Proportion of Variance Explained", ylim = c(0, 1), type = "b", xlim = c(1, 100)) 
abline(0.9,0)
#looks like we need about 70 PC's to explain 90% of the variation in this image. i.e. 90 pve
```

Selection of d principal components /
Projecting onto a lower dimensional space using d loading vectors
```{r}

  u_proj <- W 
  #we will only use the first num.pcs PC loadings so set the remaining to 0 
  u_proj[, (num_pcs[j] + 1) : 505] <- 0 
  #Make the projection 
  projection <- (Image%*%u_proj)%*%t(u_proj) 
  #to draw an image, values need to be between 0 and 1
